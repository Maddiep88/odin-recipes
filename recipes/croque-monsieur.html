<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Easily adaptable into a Monte Cristo by just adding chicken,
     this wonderful battered then fried sandwich makes a great lunch with a tossed salad.</p>

 <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard.</li>
    <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise.</li>
    <li>4 tbsp butter or margarine, softened.</li>
    <li>6 slices white bread.</li>
    <li>6 slices Swiss cheese.</li>
    <li>12 slices thinly sliced deli ham.</li>
    <li>4 tbsp all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder.</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt.</li>
    <li>2 eggs.</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water.</li>
    <li>1 tsp fresh thyme leaves, or to taste.</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps:</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Use 2 tablespoons of the butter to spread over one side of each slice of bread.
         On three of the slices, spread a layer of Dijon mustard over the butter,
          and top each with 4 slices of ham. On the other three, spread mayonnaise,
           and top each one with 2 slices of Swiss cheese. Press ham and cheese sides of sandwiches together.</li>
    <li>In a flat bottomed dish, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, eggs, and water until blended. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip both sides of each sandwich in the
         egg mixture, and fry in the oil and butter until browned, flipping to brown on each side.</li>
    <li>Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; season
         with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables
          with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender,
         about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.</li>
