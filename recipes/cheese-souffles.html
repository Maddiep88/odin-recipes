<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Cheese soufflés are light and airy baked dishes made with a rich mixture of cheese, eggs, and milk.
     They are known for their delicate texture and impressive rise. Perfect as a savory appetizer or a main course,
      cheese soufflés are a delightful treat that combines the flavors of melted cheese with the fluffiness of whipped
       egg whites. Serve them straight from the oven for the best experience.</p>

 <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>2 tbsp melted butter.</li>
    <li>2 tbsp white sugar, or as needed.</li>
    <li>2 large eggs.</li>
    <li>1 tbsp white sugar.</li>
    <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt.</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>1 tsp lemon zest.</li>
    <li>2 oz cream cheese, softened.</li>
    <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps:</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Brush butter on the bottom and up the sides of two
         5 1/2-ounce ramekins. Scoop in some sugar; rotate ramekins
          to coat while pouring most of the sugar back into its container. Place ramekins on a shallow baking pan.</li>
    <li>Separate eggs between 2 bowls. Add sugar, flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt,
         vanilla extract, lemon zest, cream cheese, and Cheddar cheese to the yolks.
          Mix the souffle base with a spatula until sugar and flour disappear.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the room-temperature egg whites. Beat with a
         whisk until soft peaks form; peaks should hold their shape but not be stiff or dry.
          Stir and fold 1/2 of the egg whites into the souffle base until combined. Gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the batter.</li>
    <li>Fill ramekins up to the lip with the batter.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and browned, about 12 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
